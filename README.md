# Progress Reward

ProgressReward is an android to-do list style app designed to help you not feel guilty about enjoying life. By completing tasks on your to-do list, you recieve points. You can then 'cash in' these points for things like watching TV, playing video games, or whatever it is you want to do and not feel guilty about it. 

If you are a very productive individual who wants to enjoy life some more, consider giving the app a try.
